**bike csv raw csv file for doing project**

**in this project we analysis the no of bike will be rented on particular date on the basis of natural climaties column and other factor**

**in this we have to predcit continous numerical variable so this is supervised regression problem**

**so we use linear regression,polynomial regression , random forest regression, xg boost regression.**

**we use  r2 score, mean squared error and root mean suqred error evaluation matrix with ridge penaulty.**

**dependant variable is rented bike column.**

**then from uploading dataset , change datatype ,data wranglling , eda process like null value remoe , outliers remove , skewness remove,convert categorical column to numerical column.**

**Also implement PCA after checking multicollinarity between independant column and also check their corelation.**

**then pass dataset into train test split and perform necessary moedliing steps and analysis their results.**

**after apply diffrent modelling finally got Xg boost regression wih hyperparametertunning with r2 score 90% on training and 88% testing with root mean sqaured error is 3.94 on traning and 4.30 on testing.**

**best features got yes(functioning day or working day) column and winter season.**

**use scatter plot , line plot , box plot , hist plot , bar plot for analysising data by visually for better understanding**
